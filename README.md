Below are some projects I have built. They are hosted on Heroku (so sometimes a dyno takes a second to spin up).


- [BlogRockinBeets](https://blog-rockin-beets.herokuapp.com/) - recipe wesbite where users can store their own recipe.

- [isOdd](https://is-odd-api.herokuapp.com/) - A joke website I built to return whether a number is odd. styled after the website iseven.xyz.

- [Veggie Wars](https://yoricktf.github.io/Veggie-wars/) - Javascript game using DOM manipulation.

- [Start page](https://startpage-yoz.herokuapp.com/) - A simple page with links when you make a new tab.

- [Meeter](https://www.meeter.me/) - A group project to find a meeting space between two locations.
